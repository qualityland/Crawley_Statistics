# The Right Kind of Statistical Analysis
# depends on:
#   - response variable (y-axis, ordinate)
#   - explanatory variables (x-axis, abscissa)

## These simple keys will then lead you to the appropriate statistical method:

# The explanatory variables:
# a) All explanatory variables continuous: Regression
# b) All explanatory variables categorical: Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
# c) Some explanatory variables continuous some categorical: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)

# The response variable:
# a) Continuous: Regression, ANOVA or ANCOVA
# b) Proportion: Logistic regression
# c) Count: Log linear models
# d) Binary: Binary logistic analysis
# e) Time at death: Survival analysis

# Error type I - reject the null hypothesis when it is TRUE
# Error type II - accept the null hypothesis when it is FALSE
